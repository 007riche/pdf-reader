v0.6.1 (12th March 2008)
- Tweaked behaviour when we encounter Identity-H encoded text that doesn't have a ToUnicode mapping. We
  just replace each character with a little box.
- Use the same little box when invalid characters are found in other encodings instead of throwing an ugly 
  NoMethodError.
- Added a method to RegisterReceiver that returns all occurances of a callback

v0.6.0 (27th February 2008)
- all text is now transparently converted to UTF-8 before being passed to the callbacks.
  before this version, text was just passed as a byte level copy of what was in the PDF file, which
  was mildly annoying with some encodings, and resulted in garbled text for Unicode encoded text.
- Fonts that use a difference table are now handled correctly
- fixed some 1.9 incompatible syntax
- expanded RegisterReceiver class to record extra info
- expanded rspec coverage
- tweaked a README example

v0.5.1 (1st January 2008)
- Several documentation tweaks
- Improve support for parsing PDFs under windows (thanks to Jari Williamsson)

v0.5 (14th December 2007)
- Initial Release
