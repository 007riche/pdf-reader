The PDF::Reader library implements a PDF parser conforming as much as possible
to the PDF specification from Adobe.

It provides programmatic access to the contents of a PDF file with a high
degree of flexibility.

The PDF 1.7 specification is a weighty document and not all aspects are
currently supported. We welcome submission of PDF files that exhibit
unsupported aspects of the spec to assist with improving out support.

= Installation

The recommended installation method is via Rubygems.

  gem install pdfreader

= Usage

PDF::Reader is designed with a callback-style architecture. The basic concept
is to build a receiver class and pass that into PDF::Reader along with the PDF
to process. 

As PDF::Reader walks the file and encounters various objects (pages, text,
images, shapes, etc) it will call methods on the receiver class.  What those
methods do is entirely up to you - save the text, extract images, count pages,
read metadata, whatever.

For a full list of the supported callback methods and a description of when they
will be called, refer to PDF::Reader::Content.

= Examples

The easiest way to explain how this works in practice is to show some examples.

== Page Counter

A simple app to count the number of pages in a PDF File.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'pdf/reader'

  class PageReceiver
    attr_accessor :page_count

    def initialize
      @page_count = 0 
    end
    
    # Called when page parsing ends
    def end_page
      @page_count += 1
    end
  end

  receiver = PageReceiver.new
  pdf = PDF::Reader.file("somefile.pdf", receiver)
  puts "#{pdf.page_count} pages"

== Extract ISBNs

Parse all text in the requested PDF file and print out any valid book ISBNs.
Requires the rbook-isbn gem.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'pdf/reader'
  require 'rbook/isbn'

  class ISBNReceiver

    # there's a few text callbacks, so make sure we process them all
    def show_text(string, *params)
      process_words(string.split(/\W+/))
    end

    def super_show_text(string, *params)
      process_words(string.split(/\W+/))
    end

    def move_to_next_line_and_show_text (string)
      process_words(string.split(/\W+/))
    end

    def set_spacing_next_line_show_text (aw, ac, string)
      process_words(string.split(/\W+/))
    end

    private

    # check if any items in the supplied array are a valid ISBN, and print any 
    # that are to console
    def process_words(words)
      words.each do |word|
        word.strip!
        puts "#{RBook::ISBN.convert_to_isbn13(word)}" if RBook::ISBN.valid_isbn?(word)
      end
    end
  end

  receiver = ISBNReceiver.new
  PDF::Reader.file("somefile.pdf", receiver)
