Some ideas for future work
- Allow the user to only process certain aspects of the PDF file. For example, if they're only
  interested in meta data, there's no point in walking the pages tree.

- Ship some extra receivers in the standard package, particuarly ones that are useful for running
  rspec over generated PDF files

- Improve metadata support

- Add support for additional filters: ASCIIHexDecode, ASCII85Decode, LZWDecode, RunLengthDecode, CCITTFaxDecode, JBIG2Decode, DCTDecode, JPXDecode, Crypt?

- Add support for additional encodings: 
  - PDFDocEncoding
  - Identity-V(?)

- Support difference tables for encodings

- Tweak encoding mappings to differentiate between bytes that are invalid for an encoding, and bytes that are unchanged

- Add a way to extract raster images
