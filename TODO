Some ideas for future work
- Allow the user to only process certain aspects of the PDF file. For example, if they're only
  interested in meta data, there's no point in walking the pages tree.

- Ship some extra receivers in the standard package, particuarly ones that are useful for running
  rspec over generated PDF files

- Improve metadata support

- Add support for additional filters: ASCIIHexDecode, ASCII85Decode, LZWDecode, RunLengthDecode, CCITTFaxDecode, JBIG2Decode, DCTDecode, JPXDecode, Crypt?

- Add support for additional encodings: 
  - MacExpertEncoding
  - PDFDocEncoding
  - Identity-V(?)
  - StandardEncoding --> http://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/ADOBE/stdenc.txt

- Support difference tables for encodings

- Add a way to extract raster images
