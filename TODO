v0.7
- Allow the user to only process certain aspects of the PDF file. For example, if they're only
  interested in meta data or bookmarks, there's no point in walking the pages tree.
  - maybe a third option to Reader.parse?
    parse(io, receiver, {:pages => true, :fonts => false, :metadata => true, :bookmarks => false})

- Tweak encoding mappings to differentiate between bytes that are invalid for an encoding, and bytes that are unchanged.
  poppler seems to do this in a quite reasonable way. Original Encoding -> Glyph Names -> Unicode. As of 0.6 we go straight
  from the Original encoding to Unicode.

v0.9
- Support for CJK text (convert to UTF-8 like all other encodings)
- Add a way to extract raster images


Sometime
- Ship some extra receivers in the standard package, particuarly ones that are useful for running
  rspec over generated PDF files

- Improve metadata support

- Add support for additional filters: ASCIIHexDecode, ASCII85Decode, LZWDecode, RunLengthDecode, CCITTFaxDecode, JBIG2Decode, DCTDecode, JPXDecode, Crypt?

- Add support for additional encodings: 
  - PDFDocEncoding
  - Identity-V(I *think* this relates to vertical text. Not sure how we'd support it sensibly)

- Investigate how R->L text is handled
