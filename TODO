Some ideas for future work
- Allows the user to only process certain aspects of the PDF file. For example, if they're only
  interested in meta data, there's no point in walking the pages tree.

- Ship some extra receivers in the standard package, particuarly ones that are useful for running
  rspec over generated PDF files

- Improve metadata support

- Add support for additional filters: ASCIIHexDecode, ASCII85Decode, LZWDecode, RunLengthDecode, CCITTFaxDecode, JBIG2Decode, DCTDecode, JPXDecode, Crypt?

- Text that is specified with a ToUnicode mapping isn't extracted properly. The untranslated values are passed to the callback.
